# ♟️ Ruby-Chess ♟️

A simple terminal-based chess game written in **Ruby**.

This project is a **fork** of an earlier open-source Ruby chess implementation.  
I’ve updated it with **improved visuals, simplified color handling**, and a **clearer introduction for players**.

---

## Features

- Fully functional chess rules (check, checkmate, stalemate, promotion)
- Play against a basic computer opponent
- ASCII-based board with Unicode chess pieces
- Simple and clean color scheme for easy readability
- Save and load games using YAML

## Notes

This is a **learning and experimental fork**, created to explore Ruby, game logic, and terminal graphics.  
It’s also a fun weekend project — not meant for competitive play, but to study how a chess engine and move validation work under the hood.
